        "**Ans.** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing code that focuses on objects—things that have data (like a person’s name and age) and actions (like walking or talking). Instead of just writing a list of instructions, OOP helps organize code into reusable and manageable pieces.  \n",

        "Think of a **class** as a blueprint, like a recipe for a cake. It defines what an object should have and do, but it’s not the actual cake. An **object** is the actual cake you bake using that recipe—it follows the blueprint but has its own unique details.  \n",
        "\n",
        "OOP has some important principles. **Encapsulation** keeps certain details hidden, like how a phone works internally, while only showing what’s needed, like buttons on the screen. **Abstraction** focuses on what’s important—like driving a car without worrying about how the engine works. **Inheritance** lets one object take features from another, just like a child inheriting traits from a parent. **Polymorphism** allows one thing to take different forms, like a single word meaning different things in different sentences.  \n",

        "\n",
        "**Abstraction** is about hiding the **details** of how something works and showing only what’s necessary. It's like when you drive a car—you don’t need to know how the engine runs, just how to operate the steering wheel, pedals, and buttons. In programming, abstraction means you create a simple interface to interact with something, without exposing the complicated inner workings. For example, in a **TV**, you just press a button to turn it on, but you don’t need to know the electronics inside.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Ans.** **Encapsulation** in Python is a way of keeping an object’s data safe by grouping both the data (attributes) and the functions (methods) that manipulate the data together in a class, while also controlling access to certain parts of the object. It helps protect the object’s internal state from being changed directly from outside the class, which ensures the object behaves correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, encapsulation is achieved using naming conventions. By default, all attributes and methods are public, meaning they can be accessed from outside the class. However, if you want to make an attribute or method private (meaning it should not be accessed directly from outside the class), you prefix it with two underscores (`__`). For example, an attribute like `self.__balance` would be considered private.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although Python doesn’t strictly prevent access to private attributes, the naming convention makes it clear that they should not be accessed directly. Instead, you can use **getter** and **setter** methods, which are functions that allow controlled access to private attributes. For instance, a method like `get_balance()` could be used to retrieve the value of a private attribute like `__balance`, ensuring that the balance is always accessed or modified in a safe way.\n",

It’s used to initialize the object's attributes, meaning it sets up the initial state of the object by giving values to its properties. The constructor is defined using the `__init__()` method, and it ensures that when an object is created, it’s ready to be used with all the necessary information it needs.\n",

Class methods are often used for factory methods or to modify class-level data. To define a class method, you use the `@classmethod` decorator.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Ans.** The advantages of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** make it a popular and effective way to write software. One of the main benefits is **modularity**, which means you can organize your code into different parts, called objects, that represent real-world things. This makes the code easier to understand and manage. Another advantage is **reusability**—you can reuse classes and objects in different parts of your program or in other projects, which saves time and effort.\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP also helps with **encapsulation**, which means keeping the data inside objects safe and controlled. You can manage how data is accessed or modified by using methods, reducing the risk of errors. Additionally, OOP supports **inheritance**, which allows new classes to take on features from existing ones. This way, you don’t have to repeat code and can easily extend the program’s functionality. Finally, **polymorphism** provides flexibility by allowing objects of different classes to be used in the same way, simplifying your code and making it easier to adapt to changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In short, OOP makes your code cleaner, more organized, and easier to maintain. It lets you reuse code, protect data, extend functionality easily, and handle different objects in a flexible way, making the development process smoother and more efficient.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Ans.** The main difference between a **class variable** and an **instance variable** is how they are shared and accessed. A **class variable** is a variable that is shared by all objects created from the class. It's defined within the class itself (but outside of any methods), and every instance of that class has access to it. If one instance changes the value of a class variable, it changes for all other instances as well, because they all share the same value.\n",

        "On the other hand, an **instance variable** is specific to each individual object. It's usually defined inside the `__init__` method and holds values that can be different for each instance of the class. Each object created from the class has its own copy of the instance variable, so changing it in one object doesn’t affect others.\n",

        "**Ans.** **Multiple inheritance** in Python is when a class can inherit features from more than one parent class. This means that a subclass can combine methods and attributes from multiple classes, which can be useful when you want to bring together different behaviors or characteristics into a single class.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if you have one class that defines how animals move and another class that defines how animals eat, a class that represents a specific type of animal could inherit from both of these parent classes to get both sets of behaviors. However, while this makes Python flexible, it can also get tricky, especially if different parent classes have methods with the same name. To handle this, Python uses something called **method resolution order (MRO)**, which ensures the right method gets called in a predictable way.\n",

        "**Ans.** In Python, the **`__str__`** and **`__repr__`** methods are used to define how an object is displayed as a string, but they have different purposes. The **`__str__`** method is used to give a user-friendly description of an object. When you use `print()` or `str()` on an object, Python calls the `__str__` method to show a simple and easy-to-read string that describes the object, typically aimed at end-users.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **`__repr__`** method, on the other hand, is meant for a more detailed or technical string representation of the object. It is used mainly for debugging or logging, and its goal is to provide a string that can give developers enough information about the object’s state. Ideally, the string returned by `__repr__` could even be used to recreate the object. If `__str__` is not defined, Python will fall back to using `__repr__` when you print the object.\n",

It simplifies the process of invoking a parent class’s method and allows you to extend or modify the inherited functionality without having to rewrite or explicitly reference the parent class. This can be particularly helpful in cases where a class might inherit from multiple parent classes, ensuring that the right method gets called according to Python’s **method resolution order (MRO)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if a subclass overrides a method from the parent class but still wants to use the original functionality from the parent class, `super()` can be used to call the parent method within the subclass. It’s also useful when you need to manage **multiple inheritance**—it helps to avoid calling methods from the same class more than once in a complex inheritance chain.\n",

        "**Ans.**\n",
        "The **`__del__`** method in Python is a special function, often referred to as a **destructor**, that is invoked when an object is about to be destroyed. It is called when there are no more references to the object, meaning it’s no longer being used or needed. This method can be useful for performing any cleanup tasks before the object is removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, if an object has opened files, network connections, or other external resources, you may want to close or release those resources explicitly to avoid potential issues like memory leaks or locked resources. The **`__del__`** method provides a way to implement this cleanup functionality. In Python, while garbage collection usually handles memory management automatically, the `__del__` method gives you more control over how resources are cleaned up when the object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, there are some important things to keep in mind when using `__del__`. It can be tricky to use in complex programs, especially if there are circular references—where objects reference each other in a cycle. Python’s garbage collector may not be able to clean up these objects immediately, and this can lead to issues with the `__del__` method. Additionally, relying too heavily on `__del__` for cleanup can sometimes introduce subtle bugs, so it’s often recommended to use context managers (via `with` statements) for managing resources when possible, as they provide a more predictable way to handle cleanup.\n",

        "A **static method** (using `@staticmethod`) doesn’t take a reference to the class (`cls`) or the instance (`self`) as its first argument. This means it doesn’t have access to any of the instance or class-level data. Static methods are often used for utility functions that are related to the class, but don’t need to interact with the class or instance. They can be called directly on the class or through an instance, but they can only use the arguments passed to them, not any internal class or instance data.\n",

It works with inheritance by letting different classes use the same method name, but each class can have its own version of that method. This is called **method overriding**. When you call a method on an object, Python will use the method that belongs to the object's class, even if you're calling it on the common superclass.\n",

        "For example, imagine you have a base class called `Animal` with a method `speak()`. Then, you create subclasses like `Dog` and `Cat`, each of which has its own version of the `speak()` method.
